# BETA MVP — Phase 1.5 Per-Class Content Audit

> **Status:** Pass 1 (grep-driven enumeration + registry audit) complete · Pass 2 (user-journey walkthrough) pending · Pass 3 (prioritization + §8 draft) pending.
> **Scope:** 3 MVP asset classes — `marina`, `str`, `multifamily`. Other classes flagged where they already have content.
> **Reading order:** Section 0 (methodology) → Section 1 (registry coverage) → Section 2 (inventory table) → Section 3 (surprises). Sections 4 + 5 added at end of Pass 2 + Pass 3.

## 0. Methodology

### Pass 1 inputs (this commit)

Five grep sweeps + four registry walk-throughs + tab-gate audit.

```
grep -rn "assetClass" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"               → 1,512 line hits
grep -rn "getModelConfig|MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY|getTabOverrides"        →    57 line hits
grep -rnE "if.*assetClass.*===" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"     →    15 line hits → 9 real branches
grep -rn "MARINA_CONFIG|STR_CONFIG|MULTIFAMILY_CONFIG"                 →    10 line hits
grep -rni "marina" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" (excl. tests)    → 8,717 line hits → ~50 unique high-density files
```

### Classification keys

- **unified** — works uniformly across all classes via registry / `getModelConfig`. No per-class code needed; per-class content lives in the registry.
- **branched** — explicit `if (assetClass === ...)` or marina-hardcoded code path in shared infrastructure.
- **hidden** — feature is implemented but tab/section is gated off for non-marina classes (`tabs.X: false`).
- **missing** — code suggests a per-class surface that doesn't exist for one or more MVP classes.
- **dedicated-vertical** — entire module/feature is asset-class-specific by design (e.g., `marinamatch/`, `dockit/`, salescomps for marinas). Not a "leak"; cataloged separately.

### Surface = user-visible product touchpoint OR registry entry that drives one

A "surface" is a tab, a form section, a report, a KPI tile, a document template, a wizard step, a registry field group, an LLM prompt, a column set — NOT a single line of code. Line-grep hits are noise-reduced to surfaces.

### Stop conditions evaluated

- **>200 surfaces** → re-scope. Current count: ~80 surfaces. **OK to proceed.**
- **Major undocumented architectural assumption surfaces** → stop and surface. **One found** (orphan valuator-* stack, Section 3); not blocking — documented in §3.5 carry-over candidates.
- **Spec draft >500 lines** → consider separating audit doc permanently. Currently planning audit doc as separate companion. **Plan stands.**

## 1. Registry coverage matrix

The four parallel registries (per memory `project_four_registries_2026_05_17`) determine engine + UI behavior per asset class. Coverage of the 3 MVP classes is **100% in all 4 registries**.

| Registry | Location | Total classes | Marina | STR | MF | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY | `shared/asset-class-model-config.ts:4412` | 32 | full (169 lines) | full (188 lines) | full (199 lines) | All three configs include `docIntelPromptHints`. |
| COA_REGISTRY (engine) | `server/services/direct-input-engine.ts:608` | 30 routed | MARINA_COA (~35 lines) | STR_COA (~264 lines, very rich) | MULTIFAMILY_COA (~34 lines) | STR_COA is by far the deepest. MF + Marina are thinner. |
| COA_FIELD_REGISTRY (UI) | `shared/direct-input-coa.ts:898` | 29 | MARINA_FIELDS (27 lines) | STR_FIELDS (57 lines) | MULTIFAMILY_FIELDS (50 lines) | Marina field set is shortest in this registry. |
| PRO_FORMA_REGISTRY | `shared/pro-forma-config.ts:934` | 30 | MARINA_PRO_FORMA (7 revenue items) | STR_PRO_FORMA (3 revenue items) | MULTIFAMILY_PRO_FORMA (5 revenue items, indented + EGI subtotal) | All three have distinct shapes. STR has fewer line items by design. |

### Depth-mismatch flags (within MVP classes)

- **COA_REGISTRY depth asymmetry:** STR ~264 lines vs Marina ~35 vs MF ~34. STR_COA was the focus of Day 9 work per memory `project_str_coverage_audit_2026_05_19`. Marina and MF COAs may be under-built for institutional depth.
- **COA_FIELD_REGISTRY depth asymmetry:** Marina has the shortest field list (27 lines) of any MVP class. Suggests upload-pipeline UX gap when seeding new marina projects with direct input.
- **PRO_FORMA_REGISTRY revenue line counts:** Marina 7, MF 5, STR 3. Marina is the most line-itemized; STR rolls cleaning fees + nightly into compact "Total Revenue" structure.

### Doc-intel prompt hints coverage

All 3 MVP classes have `docIntelPromptHints` populated in `MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY`. Per memory the doc-intel branching is shipped (commit `11b7f18f` 2026-05-18). Non-MVP classes fall back to `DEFAULT_DOC_INTEL_PROMPT_HINTS` (generic CRE).

### Tab visibility gates (`tabs: { ... }` per config)

| Class | storageLeases | physicalStorage | commercialLeases | profitCenters | replacementCost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Marina | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Multifamily | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | — |
| STR | ✓ | — | — | — | — |

Marina is the only MVP class with `replacementCost: true`. Per spec §3.5, this is the worked example for the Phase 4 per-class content build.

---

## 2. Surface inventory

Rows are listed by category. Each row is one product surface (tab/form/report/template/wizard step/registry-driven content block). Classification follows the keys in §0.

Coverage column convention:
- **full** = class-specific content shipped and visible
- **partial** = class-specific config present but content thin or generic fallback
- **none** = no class-specific content; falls back to generic OR marina-default OR is hidden
- **N/A** = surface intentionally not applicable to this class

### 2.A — Registry-driven (unified shared infrastructure, per-class content lives in 4 registries)

### 2.B — Workspace tabs (55 distinct tabs in `client/src/pages/modeling/projects/workspace.tsx:156-267`)

Groups: Overview (3) · Inputs & Data (5) · Uploads (1) · Financial Model (18) · Analysis (14) · Fund & Portfolio (6) · Scenarios (4) · Output (4) = 55 tabs.

Most are unified (single component, registry-driven content). Listed below are tabs that are **explicitly per-class** (branched, hidden, or have class-specific content):

### 2.F — Branched code paths (explicit `if (assetClass === 'X')`)

| # | Surface | Location | Branch on | Marina behavior | STR behavior | MF behavior | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## 3. Pass 1 surprises worth Brett's attention

### S1. Orphan valuator-* stack — 5,375 lines of dead marina-specific code

**Finding:** Nine `valuator-*.tsx` files (boat rentals, fuel sales, ship store, service dept, parking lot, bookkeeping, commercial tenants, operations summary, profit centers orchestrator) total 5,375 lines and are imported by `workspace.tsx:104` but never rendered. `workspace.tsx:999` renders `ProfitCentersDynamic` instead.

**Status:** Pre-dynamic-era marina-specific profit-center UIs, made obsolete when `profit-centers-dynamic.tsx` shipped to drive content from `MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY.profitCenters.departments`.

**Implication:** Big bundle-size + maintenance overhead with zero user-facing value. Surface to §3.5 as a cleanup candidate.

**Recommendation:** Delete the entire `valuator-*` stack OR (if any logic should be preserved) reconcile against `ProfitCentersDynamic` first to identify any UI patterns worth migrating into the dynamic version.

### S2. STR has no OM template, no DD template, no rent-roll-v2 adapter

**Finding:**
- `server/templates/om-templates/`: marina-om, multifamily-om, hotel-om, industrial-om, retail-om — **no str-om.ts**.
- `server/templates/ddTemplates/`: marina.ts + generalCre.ts fallback — STR and MF both fall back to generic CRE.
- `server/services/rent-roll-v2/assetStrategies/`: marina, multifamily, hotel, retail, rvPark, selfStorage, cre, default — **no str.ts**.

**Implication:** A friendly trying to demo an end-to-end STR workflow today has no class-specific OM, DD checklist, or rent-roll lifecycle. They get the generic CRE fallback.

**Recommendation:** STR OM template, STR DD checklist, and STR rent-roll v2 adapter are three concrete Phase 4 scope items.

### S3. Marina has the shortest field set in COA_FIELD_REGISTRY (27 lines)

**Finding:** Marina's direct-input field list is 27 lines vs STR 57 vs MF 50. Suggests marina's direct-input flow asks the user for fewer assumptions than STR or MF — which is institutionally odd given marinas are operating-business-heavy (fuel, store, service, boat rentals).

**Implication:** The 9 valuator-* surfaces (marina-specific operating ledger UIs) were *supposed* to fill this gap pre-dynamic. Now they're orphan, so the gap is real: direct-input marina projects can't enter fuel/store/service/boat-rental assumptions through the new flow.

**Cross-link with S1:** Deleting valuator-* without restoring this content shipped via `ProfitCentersDynamic` would regress marina.

**Recommendation:** Audit whether `ProfitCentersDynamic` actually captures the operating-business inputs that `valuator-*` previously captured. If yes, S1 is safe to delete. If no, that's a real per-class content gap for marina, not just STR/MF.

### S4. `WizardData.marinaName` / `marinaAddress` leak to non-marina projects

**Finding:** `OnboardingWizard.tsx:285-286,466-467` defines `marinaName: string; marinaAddress: MarinaAddress` on the wizard state. Non-marina classes go through the same wizard but inherit this field shape. The wizard's multi-property mode iterates `validMarinas`, not `validProperties`.

**Implication:** Asset-class-agnostic principle #1 (§5) violation at the wizard data layer. Affects every non-marina friendly who goes through onboarding. May explain why some downstream consumers default to marina (per branch #65 in the table — token-resolver assumes marina when missing).

**Recommendation:** Rename `marinaName` → `entityName` / `propertyName` and `marinaAddress` → `propertyAddress`. Treat as a Phase 1 cleanup; not a Phase 1.5 content gap.

### S5. PROFIT_CENTER_CATALOG and AMENITY_CATALOG in `shared/marina-catalog.ts` are marina-only

**Finding:** These catalogs power the wizard's Profit Centers and Amenities steps. They're entirely marina-specific (17 profit centers — wet slips, fuel, ship's store, boat sales, dockage; 20 amenities — pump-out, shore power, dinghy dock). Non-marina classes have these steps hidden via `shouldShowStep`, so they don't see them.

**Implication:** For MF, the wizard has a Profit Centers step that DOES show (because `cfg.profitCenters.showTab=true`), but it uses the marina catalog. (Needs Pass 2 verification — likely the MF wizard renders profit-centers via a different code path, but if not, this is a wizard-level branched-content bug.)

**Recommendation:** Verify in Pass 2 Journey A (MF wizard) whether profit-centers step content is marina-leaking. If yes, the catalog needs to become per-class or the step needs to read from `MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY.profitCenters.departments` directly.

### S6. Marina is the only MVP class with `tabs.commercialLeases: true`

**Finding:** Per the registry tab gates, marina has 5/5 tabs on; MF has 3/5 on; STR has 1/5 on.

**Implication:** Marina projects show Commercial Leases tab. MF projects don't, even though many MF properties have retail/commercial space on ground floor (mixed-use overlap). STR projects don't (correctly — STRs don't have commercial tenants).

**Recommendation:** Open product question: should MF show Commercial Leases when the project is mixed-use-ish? Not blocking for MVP; surface in §6 open decisions.

### S7. STR COA is 7x deeper than Marina or MF COA

**Finding:** `STR_COA` = ~264 lines · `MARINA_COA` = ~35 lines · `MULTIFAMILY_COA` = ~34 lines. The depth was built into STR during Day 9 work (memory `project_str_coverage_audit_2026_05_19`).

**Implication:** STR direct-input math is the deepest of the 3 MVP classes. Marina and MF math is comparatively under-built. This explains why "the fixture seed pattern" can be copied STR→MF (memory `38421aea` reference) but marina has a different ledger model entirely (operating business, not just rental income).

**Recommendation:** Pass 3 prioritization should weigh whether to bring marina + MF COAs to STR-depth, or to accept that marina/MF have simpler structural models. Probably MF deserves more depth; marina deserves the operating-business content currently orphaned in valuator-*.

---

## 4. Journey friction log (Pass 2)

### 4.0 Methodology note

This is a **code-walkthrough** journey, not a live browser-clickthrough. The dev server was not started for this pass — instead, every component, route, and registry the user would touch in each step was read directly. This is honest about its limits: I can verify what the code does today, but not screen-level rendering quirks (z-index issues, CSS regressions, race conditions, exact pixel positioning). Where browser-only friction would only surface via UI, I flag it explicitly as `[needs-browser-verify]`.

### 4.1 S1 verification — CRITICAL result

**Pass 1 framing was wrong, and the corrected finding is more useful than the original concern.**

**What I expected to find:** `ProfitCentersDynamic` covers X% of valuator-*'s functionality; the gap = marina content that needs to move.

**What I actually found:** `ProfitCentersDynamic` and the orphan `valuator-*` stack solve **different problems**. They are not migration peers.

**Evidence:**

- `ProfitCentersDynamic` (`workspace/profit-centers-dynamic.tsx`, 386 lines): reads `getModelConfig(assetClass).profitCenters.departments`. For each department, the user enters **forward-looking monthly $ assumptions** in three buckets (revenue / COGS / expense). It's a **modeling-assumption form** for the multi-year projection. State persists to `modeling_projects.profitCentersData`.

- `valuator-fuel-sales.tsx` (657 lines): reads `/api/operations-context/projects/:projectId/ops/fuel`. Per-transaction record entry — `txnDate`, `fuelType`, `gallons`, `grossSales`, `cogs`. It's an **operational ledger entry UI**, not modeling. Same pattern in `valuator-ship-store.tsx` (per-transaction `category`, `grossSales`, `cogs`, `txnCount`) and `valuator-boat-rentals.tsx` (per-rental `rentalDate`, `hours`, `grossSales`, `channel`, `boatType`).

- The **real successor to valuator-*** is the `pages/operations/` tabbed-module stack, e.g., `pages/operations/fuel/{Dashboard,Transactions,Inventory,Analytics,Reports,FinancialModel,ImportHistory,AuditTrail}.tsx` (10 dedicated fuel module files). Same pattern for Ship Store (`ShipStoreTabbed.tsx`), Boat Rentals (`BoatRentalsTabbed.tsx`), Service (`ServiceTabbed.tsx`), Boat Club, Boat Sales, Bookkeeping, etc.

**S1 result: valuator-* IS safe to delete.** The 5,375 lines are dead code superseded by the `pages/operations/*Tabbed.tsx` stack (which is the active operations-context UI in the sidebar) AND by `ProfitCentersDynamic` (which is the active modeling-assumption UI in the workspace).

**Overlap calculation: 0%.** No content lives only in `valuator-*` that doesn't live in either the ops-context successors or the modeling-dynamic component. ProfitCentersDynamic covers the modeling axis (forward $/mo assumptions). The ops/* tabbed modules cover the operations axis (per-transaction record entry).

**Architectural correction for the audit doc:** Pass 1 S3 ("Marina has the shortest field set in COA_FIELD_REGISTRY") is NOT actually masked by valuator-* migration risk. The valuator-* stack was never feeding COA_FIELD content — that's a different axis entirely. The shallow MARINA_FIELDS (27 lines) remains a real but separate content gap.

### 4.2 S5 verification — Profit Centers step in MF wizard

**Result: NOT a leak.** Wizard's Profit Centers step uses `getAssetClassCatalog(assetClass)` (line 514 in `OnboardingWizard.tsx`), which dispatches to per-class catalogs in `shared/asset-class-catalog.ts` (a separate registry from `marina-catalog.ts`).

For MF wizard pass, user sees the 7 entries in `MULTIFAMILY_PROFIT_CENTERS`: Residential Rent, Parking, Laundry & Vending, Pet Fees, Storage Units, Application & Admin Fees, Utility Reimbursement.

For STR wizard pass, user sees the 5 entries in `STR_PROFIT_CENTERS`: Nightly Revenue, Cleaning Fees, Extra Guest Fees, Pet Fees, Early/Late Check Fees.

**However, S5 produced a new finding:** there are now **two parallel per-class profit-center registries** in the codebase:
1. `MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY[ac].profitCenters.departments` (used by workspace's `ProfitCentersDynamic`)
2. `asset-class-catalog.ts.{ASSET}_PROFIT_CENTERS` (used by wizard)

These DO NOT MATCH. For MF:
- Workspace registry has 6 departments: parking, laundry_vending, pet_fees, utility_reimbursement, storage_units, application_fees.
- Wizard catalog has 7 entries: residential_rent + the same 6.

That's the only difference (workspace registry assumes residential rent is modeled via the unit-mix tab, not as a "profit center"), but the dual-source for the same conceptual data is fragile. **NEW SURFACE — flagging as a registry drift candidate for §3.5.**

### 4.3 Journey A — Investor/Operator evaluating MF deal

Friction entries reference the surface number from Section 2 where applicable. Severity scale: **blocker** (cannot complete journey) · **friction** (works but jarring) · **nice-to-have** (could be better) · **none** (works correctly).

| # | Step | What user sees | Class-appropriate? | Marina-leaking? | Missing content? | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Login → land on dashboard (`pages/dashboard.tsx`) | Dashboard renders persona-driven modules (QuickAccessSection, FundSelector, RevenueCharts, CRMCharts, etc.). Imports `Fuel`, `ShoppingCart`, `Anchor` icons among many — these only render when their module is enabled. | Yes — dashboard is module-driven, not class-driven. | No (icons present but only render for relevant modules). | MF-specific KPI tiles (NOI, $/Unit, Cap Rate, Avg Rent) don't appear on dashboard unless a specific module wires them. Friendly may not see a "this is a multifamily portfolio at a glance" landing. | nice-to-have |
| A2 | Open New Project Wizard | Dialog title shows `<Anchor />` icon if `assetClass==="marina"`, else `<Building2 />` (line 2425 of `OnboardingWizard.tsx`). MF gets generic Building2 — not class-appropriate (a Home or Building icon would fit). | Partial — class detection works, but only 2 icons defined. | Yes — anchor icon is the privileged path. | Per-class wizard icon. Trivial fix. | friction |
| A3 | Wizard step 1: Welcome | Generic welcome step. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A4 | Wizard step 2: Deal Structure | Generic deal-structure picker (single vs portfolio). DealType options include `"owned_marina"` but no MF analog like `"owned_property"` (see Pass 1 row 48). | Partial. | Yes — DealType has marina-flavored enum. | MF-equivalent ownership state. | friction |
| A5 | Wizard step 3: Property Details | Heading reads `{assetTerms.heading}` — class-aware. Property name field is labeled `{assetTerms.property}` (good). **BUT** the underlying state is `state.marinaName` and `state.marinaAddress` regardless of class. UI = correct; data = S4 leak. | Partial (UI correct, data wrong). | Yes — at the data layer (S4). | None visible to user; downstream consumers of project state see `marinaName` on a non-marina project. | friction (UI ok, data integrity issue) |
| A6 | Wizard step 4: Deal Type | Generic. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A7 | Wizard step 5: Profit Centers | Renders 7 MF-appropriate entries from `MULTIFAMILY_PROFIT_CENTERS` in `asset-class-catalog.ts`. Each is a toggle. (S5 confirmed not a leak.) | Yes. | No. | Could be deeper (no per-department revenue ranges shown at this step). | none |
| A8 | Wizard step 6: Amenities | Renders 12 MF-appropriate entries (pool, fitness center, clubhouse, dog park, etc.) from `MULTIFAMILY_AMENITIES`. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A9 | Wizard step 7: Storage | Step **HIDDEN** for MF via `shouldShowStep` (`cfg.tabs.physicalStorage = false` for MF). | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A10 | Wizard step 8: Documents | Generic upload step. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A11 | Wizard step 9: Features | Generic feature-flag picker. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A12 | Wizard step 10: Get Started | Generic CTA. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A13 | Land in workspace → Overview tab | `overview-dynamic.tsx` reads `config.kpis` from MULTIFAMILY_CONFIG. Shows 8 KPI tiles: Purchase Price, Cap Rate, Total Units (icon: `home`), NOI, $/Unit, Avg Rent/Unit, Occupancy, Expense Ratio. All MF-appropriate. | Yes. | No. | Could add MF-specific tiles: Loss-to-Lease (already in inputs), Renewal Rate, Concessions. Not blocking. | none |
| A14 | Inputs & Assumptions tab | Renders 5 MF input sections from `MULTIFAMILY_CONFIG.inputSections`: Property Details (12 fields), Rent Assumptions (8 fields), Other Income (8 fields), Operating Expenses (18 fields), Capital Reserves (5 fields). Total ~51 MF-specific fields. | Yes — rich and MF-appropriate. | No. | None obvious. | none |
| A15 | Property Tax tab | Universal; works for MF. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A16 | Storage Leases tab (renamed "Unit Mix" via `unitMix.tabLabel`) | `unit-mix-leases.tsx` (class-aware per Task 4) reads `unitMix.types` from MULTIFAMILY_CONFIG. Shows 9 MF unit types (Studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, 2BR/1.5BA, 3BR/2BA, 3BR/2.5BA, 4BR+, Townhome). Column labels: "Units" + "Avg Rent/Mo" + "Avg SF". Rate type: monthly. | Yes — Task 4 working. | **tabIcon leak** — `unitMix.tabIcon='home'` in MF config, but workspace TAB_GROUPS line 174 hardcodes `Anchor` icon for the "storage-leases" tab entry. Per §3.5 unitMix tabIcon entry — marina-flavored icon leaks to MF/STR. | None content-wise. | friction |
| A17 | Commercial Leases tab | **HIDDEN** for MF (`tabs.commercialLeases = false`). | Yes. | No. | Per S6 — mixed-use MF might want this. Open product question. | none for MVP MF |
| A18 | Profit Centers tab (renamed "Other Income" via `profitCenters.tabLabel`) | `ProfitCentersDynamic` renders the 6 MF departments. User can toggle each, enter monthly $ revenue / monthly $ COGS / monthly $ expense per line item. | Yes. | No. | Per S3 — depth is flat; no volume × rate modeling. Acceptable for MF (revenue is mostly rent-based, covered in unit mix). | none |
| A19 | Document Uploads tab | Universal upload UI. Asset-class-aware doc-intel prompt (commit 11b7f18f) applies during extraction. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A20 | Upload an MF P&L → categorization output | LLM uses `multifamily` docIntelPromptHints (revenueDepts: gross_potential_rent, vacancy_loss, concessions, bad_debt, parking, laundry_vending, pet_fees, utility_reimbursement, etc.). | Yes — shipped 2026-05-18. | No. | `inferDeptForActual` has a `TODO: assetClass not in scope` per §3.5 — uses default vocabulary. **Possible department mis-routing** for MF "Trash Reimbursement"-type lines (§3.5 reimbursement routing entry). | friction |
| A21 | Historical P&L tab | Universal. Renders extracted/promoted actuals. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A22 | Pro Forma tab | `pro-forma.tsx` renders `MULTIFAMILY_PRO_FORMA` shape: GPR → vacancy/concessions/badDebt (indented) → effectiveRent → otherIncome → EGI → 9 operating expense lines → totalExpenses → NOI. | Yes — MF-appropriate structure. | No. | None visible. | none |
| A23 | Pro Forma Charts tab | TBD `[needs-browser-verify]`. Memory `project_pro_forma_chart_flat_zero_bug` says chart plots y=0 across 2026-2030 in some configurations. | Pre-existing bug. | No. | Bug per §3.5. | blocker (if bug triggers for MF) |
| A24 | Stabilized NOI tab | Universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A25 | Pricing tab | Universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A26 | CapEx Budget tab | Universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A27 | Debt / Loan Sizing / Capital Stack | Universal fund-level math. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A28 | Exit Strategy tab | Universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A29 | DCF tab | Universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A30 | Returns / Multi-Year / Tax & Distributions | Universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A31 | Analytics tab | Universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A32 | IRR Attribution tab | Universal. Per §3.5, open product question (keep/remove/tier-gate). | Yes. | No. | UX gap. | nice-to-have |
| A33 | Mark-to-Market tab | Universal. Per §3.5, needs tooltip explanation. | Yes. | No. | UX gap. | nice-to-have |
| A34 | **Replacement Cost tab** | **HIDDEN** for MF (`tabs.replacementCost = false`). User does not see this tab. | Yes — appropriate hidden. | No. | If MF Phase 4 wants Replacement Cost, needs MF-specific cost inputs (e.g., $/SF construction + soft costs + land), entirely new component. The existing `replacement-cost.tsx` is 100% marina-hardcoded (floating docks, pilings, slips, dry racks). | none for MVP; **large** for Phase 4 if scoped |
| A35 | Pro Forma Charts / Scenario Compare / Deal Compare / Sensitivity / Monte Carlo / Stress Tests / Benchmark Overlay / Comp Adjustments | All universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A36 | Operator Benchmark tab | TBD — likely marina-flavored given the marina vertical's benchmark data sources. `[needs-browser-verify]` | Unknown. | Possible. | TBD. | nice-to-have to verify |
| A37 | Environmental Risk tab | Universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A38 | Fund Metrics / Fund Cash Flow / G&A / GP Partners / LP Reporting / Portfolio Risk | Universal fund-level. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A39 | Scenarios group: Cases / Model Versions / Assumption Audit / Audit Trail | Audit Trail tab returns 500 per §3.5 / memory `project_audit_trail_500`. Assumption Audit returns HTML instead of JSON per §3.5. Cases + Versions universal. | Pre-existing bugs. | No. | Bugs per §3.5. | friction (pre-existing) |
| A40 | IC Memo tab | Universal — though token resolver has marina branches (Pass 1 #64, #65 — `slips ?? capacity ?? units` fallback, marina assumed when missing). For MF, would render with `capacity ?? units` path. | Mostly yes. | Minor (token-resolver marina default). | None content-wise. | nice-to-have (clean up branches) |
| A41 | Investment Materials tab | Renders OM-builder hub. Available OM templates filtered by asset class via `getOMTemplatesByAssetClass`. MF gets `multifamilyOMTemplate` (rich, 9+ sections: Exec Summary, Property Overview with unit mix, Financial Analysis with rent roll summary, Rent Roll, Market Overview with submarket demographics, Comparable Sales, Photos, Operations, Appendix). | Yes — full MF coverage. | No. | None. | none |
| A42 | Comps & Links tab | Universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A43 | Export tab | Universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A44 | Generate IC Memo / OM (download) | MF gets `multifamilyOMTemplate.sections` rendered via doc-builder. Sections include unit mix, rent roll, market demographics. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| A45 | Generate DD checklist | **No MF-specific DD template exists.** Falls back to `generalCre.ts` (Pass 1 #53). Friendly sees generic CRE DD items, not MF-tailored items (e.g., no "verify rent roll vs lease files," "T-12 OpEx variance analysis," "submarket vacancy analysis," "lease audit"). | Partial — works but thin. | No (just generic). | Yes — MF DD checklist depth. | friction |
| A46 | Open same project in CRM (`pages/deal-detail.tsx` or `[workspaceId].tsx`) | Deal record page renders. Asset-class field shows "multifamily" badge. | Yes. | No detected. | Per memory `project_deal_workspace_audit_2026_05_07` — there are two deal record pages (13-tab vs 8-tab); marina copy still leaks in one of them. `[needs-browser-verify]` | friction (likely) |
| A47 | Sidebar Operations menu for MF user | If `multifamily_ops` module is enabled, sidebar shows "Multifamily Ops" link → `MultifamilyTabbed`. Has 4 ops tabs: Dashboard, Units, Lease Expiry, Turn Tracking. Marina-only sidebar items (Fuel Sales, Ship Store, Boat Rentals, Boat Club, Boat Sales, Service & Parts, Dockit) are filtered out based on `opsModuleKey`. | Yes. | No (filtered out by module key). | MF has only **4 ops tabs**, marina has **8 dedicated modules**. MF ops depth is shallow by comparison. | friction (MF user has less ops surface than marina user) |

### 4.4 Journey B — Owner uploading marina P&L (Keystone Point)

| # | Step | What user sees | Class-appropriate? | Non-marina-leaking? | Missing content? | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Login → land on dashboard | Same dashboard component as Journey A. Marina-specific ops modules (Fuel, Ship Store, Boat Rentals, etc.) show up as sidebar items when their packs are active. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| B2 | Open Keystone Point project from project list | Workspace loads with marina config. Anchor icon in title, marina KPIs in Overview. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| B3 | Inputs & Assumptions tab | `MARINA_CONFIG.inputSections` shows 2 sections: General Assumptions (4 fields), Seasonality (2 fields). **27 total lines in MARINA_FIELDS** (Pass 1 finding S3). | Partial. | No. | Yes — marina inputs are **thinner than MF's 51 fields**. Friendly entering a marina by hand has very few assumption fields available, even though marina is an operating business with rich underwriting (per-pump fuel margin, average ticket, slip occupancy by type, service labor utilization, etc.). | friction |
| B4 | Storage Leases tab | Renders 15 marina unit-mix types via `MARINA_CONFIG.unitMix.types` (Wet Slips Fixed/Floating/T-Head/Side-Tie/Mega/Superyacht, Moorings, Anchorage, Lift Slips, Dinghies, Dry Stack/Rack Indoor, Trailer Parking, RV Sites, Vehicle Parking, Kayak/Paddleboard, Jet Ski, etc.). Column labels: "Slips / Spaces" + "Monthly Rate". Rate type: monthly. Seasonal switches available per type. | Yes — rich. | No. | None. | none |
| B5 | Profit Centers tab | `ProfitCentersDynamic` renders 7 marina departments (Fuel Sales, Ship's Store, Service & Repairs, Boat Rentals, Boat Club, F&B/Restaurant, Third-Party Leases). User toggles each + enters monthly $ revenue / COGS / expense per line item. Each line type has 3 default lines (e.g., Fuel Sales has Gas/Diesel/Pump-Out + COGS + Labor). | Yes. | No. | **S3 confirmed:** ProfitCentersDynamic is flat $/mo entry per line. NO volume × margin modeling (no "gallons sold × markup per gallon", no "labor hours × billable rate", no "occupancy × ticket × turns"). For marina underwriting, this is structurally lighter than needed. Per S1, the deep operational modeling lives in the `pages/operations/fuel/*` tabbed modules — but those don't feed marina's modeling assumptions (they capture actuals only). | friction (marina-modeling math is thinner than marina-ops math) |
| B6 | Physical Storage tab | Only marina has `tabs.physicalStorage = true`. Wizard's Storage step is also gated on this. `[needs-browser-verify]` — what does this tab actually show? May be redundant with Storage Leases. | TBD. | No. | TBD. | nice-to-have to verify |
| B7 | Commercial Leases tab | `tabs.commercialLeases = true` for marina. Renders generic commercial-lease UI (third-party leases at marina, e.g., restaurant tenant). | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| B8 | Replacement Cost tab | Marina-only. `replacement-cost.tsx` renders 15+ marina-specific cost inputs: floating dock cost per LF, total dock LF, piling cost, piling count, electrical per slip, water per slip, total slips, dry rack cost per unit, dry rack units, building $/SF, total building SF, soft costs %, developer profit %, acquisition price. Outputs: total replacement cost, discount to replacement, replacement multiple, $/slip, cost component pie chart. | Yes — rich. | No. | None for marina. (Per §3.5 this is the worked example — exists for marina, missing for STR/MF.) | none |
| B9 | Upload marina P&L | Marina docIntelPromptHints (persona: "marina/boat storage financial analyst", revenueDepts: storage, fuel, marina_amenities, ship_store_retail, service, parts, ...). Plus the 4 marina-hardcoded regex paths in doc-intel-service.ts (L211/L219, L2401-2441, L2528) trigger for marina. | Yes — rich extraction. | No. | None. | none |
| B10 | Historical P&L | Extracted actuals render. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| B11 | Pro Forma | MARINA_PRO_FORMA: 7 revenue items (Wet Slip, Dry Storage, Fuel, Ship Store, Service, Other) → total → 9 expense items → NOI. | Yes — rich. | No. | None. | none |
| B12 | Pro Forma Charts | Same potential bug as Journey A23 per §3.5. `[needs-browser-verify]` | Pre-existing bug. | No. | Bug per §3.5. | blocker if bug fires |
| B13 | DCF / Returns / Exit / Waterfall etc | Universal. | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| B14 | Investment Materials → generate Marina OM | `marinaOMTemplate` rendered (rich marina-specific sections). | Yes. | No. | None. | none |
| B15 | DD checklist → generate marina DD | `marina.ts` DD template (rich marina-specific items per `server/templates/ddTemplates/marina.ts`). | Yes — only class with dedicated DD. | No. | None. | none |
| B16 | Open Keystone Point in CRM | Asset-class field shows "marina". Per memory `project_deal_workspace_audit_2026_05_07`, marina copy still leaks in one of the two deal record pages (13-tab vs 8-tab variants). `[needs-browser-verify]` | Mostly yes. | N/A (no non-marina to leak). | None. | none |
| B17 | Sidebar Operations menu for marina user | Marina user sees: Bookkeeping, Payroll, Dockit, Rent Roll, Commercial Tenants, Fuel Sales, Ship Store, Service & Parts, Boat Rentals, Boat Club, Boat Sales, Marketing, Budgeting. **13 ops modules.** Each is a fully-tabbed module (e.g., FuelSalesTabbed has 9 sub-tabs: Dashboard, Transactions, Inventory, Analytics, Reports, FinancialModel, ImportHistory, AuditTrail, IntegrationSettings). | Yes — rich. | No. | None. | none |

### 4.5 New surfaces discovered in Pass 2 (not in Pass 1 inventory)

These are surfaces grep missed in Pass 1 because they're in directories or use patterns the Pass 1 sweep didn't query. Adding to inventory.

| # | Surface | Location | Category | Classification | Marina | STR | MF | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 80 | Operations sidebar (18+ module entries gated by `opsModuleKey`) | `client/src/components/unified-sidebar.tsx:73-91` | navigation | unified (module-gated) | 13 modules | **0 dedicated** | 4 (via MultifamilyTabbed) | Operations sidebar coverage is wildly asymmetric across MVP classes. STR friendlies have NO class-specific operations entry point. |
| 81 | Class-specific tabbed ops modules | `client/src/pages/operations/{Multifamily,Hotel,RetailOffice,SelfStorage,FuelSales,ShipStore,Service,BoatRentals,BoatClub,BoatSales,Dockit,Bookkeeping,Marketing,Budgeting,Payroll,RentRoll}Tabbed.tsx` | tabbed-module | dedicated-per-class | full × 8 | **none** | full × 1 (MultifamilyTabbed: 4 tabs) | STR has zero dedicated ops modules. MF has one (4 tabs). Marina has 8+ (each with 5-9 sub-tabs). |
| 82 | `pages/operations/fuel/*` (10 files) | `client/src/pages/operations/fuel/{Dashboard,Transactions,Inventory,Analytics,Reports,FinancialModel,ImportHistory,AuditTrail,IntegrationSettings,Settings}.tsx` | per-class deep ops UI | dedicated-per-class | full (very deep) | N/A | N/A | The "real successor" to `valuator-fuel-sales.tsx`. Confirms S1 result. |
| 83 | `pages/operations/multifamily/*` (4 files) | `Dashboard.tsx, Units.tsx, LeaseExpiry.tsx, TurnTracking.tsx` | per-class deep ops UI | dedicated-per-class | N/A | N/A | full (shallow vs marina equivalent) | MF ops module exists but is much shallower than marina's stack. |
| 84 | `pages/operations/<class>` STR path | does not exist | per-class deep ops UI | missing | N/A | **none** | N/A | STR friendlies cannot access class-specific operations UI. |
| 85 | Parallel per-class profit-center catalogs (S5 finding) | `MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY[ac].profitCenters.departments` vs `asset-class-catalog.ts.{ASSET}_PROFIT_CENTERS` | registry | drift | both registries populated, slightly different content (MF: 6 in workspace vs 7 in wizard) | both populated | both populated | **Registry drift candidate for §3.5.** Single source of truth violation — two registries with same conceptual data and similar but non-identical entries. |
| 86 | Property Details wizard step function name `renderMarinaDetailsStep` | `OnboardingWizard.tsx:1266` | wizard-internal | branched (marina-named function for universal step) | full | full | full | Functionally universal but name leaks marina origin; cosmetic but reinforces S4 narrative. |
| 87 | Wizard dialog header icon | `OnboardingWizard.tsx:2425` | wizard | branched | Anchor icon | Building2 (generic) | Building2 (generic) | Only marina gets a class-specific dialog icon; trivial fix — read from `config.unitMix.tabIcon` or similar. |
| 88 | Portfolio mode terminology `portfolioMarinas` | `OnboardingWizard.tsx:1284,701` | wizard-data | branched | full | partial | partial | Even for non-marina portfolio mode, internal state and variable names are `validMarinas` / `portfolioMarinas`. Pairs with S4. |

### 4.6 Pass 2 articulation block

**Friction log entries by severity:**

| Severity | Count |
|---|---|
| blocker | 2 (Pro Forma Charts bug A23/B12 — pre-existing, fires under unknown conditions) |
| friction | 12 (mostly thin content + label/icon/data-name leaks + pre-existing §3.5 bugs) |
| nice-to-have | 6 |
| none | ~40 (universal surfaces working as expected) |

**S1 migration-completeness result: 0% overlap between ProfitCentersDynamic and valuator-* stack.** They solve different problems. Valuator-* is operations-context ledger entry; ProfitCentersDynamic is modeling-assumption form. Real successor to valuator-* is the `pages/operations/*Tabbed.tsx` stack. **Recommendation: safe to delete valuator-* stack with zero functional regression.** Pass 1 S3 (thin MARINA_FIELDS) is a separate concern not masked by valuator-* migration risk.

**S5 confirmation result: NOT a leak.** Wizard uses `getAssetClassCatalog(assetClass)` which dispatches to per-class catalogs in `shared/asset-class-catalog.ts`. MF gets MF content, STR gets STR content. **But** Pass 2 found a related issue: two parallel per-class profit-center registries exist (workspace's `MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY[ac].profitCenters.departments` vs wizard's `asset-class-catalog.ts.{ASSET}_PROFIT_CENTERS`) — registry drift candidate for §3.5.

**New surfaces found in Pass 2 (not in Pass 1 inventory): 9 (rows 80-88).** Well under the 20-surface stop condition. Key adds:
- Operations sidebar module asymmetry (marina 13 / MF 4 / STR 0)
- Class-specific tabbed-ops module stack (marina 8 / MF 1 / STR 0)
- Parallel profit-center registry drift
- Wizard dialog icon leak

**Architectural correction worth surfacing:** The audit's most useful Pass 2 finding is that **the operations sidebar + per-class tabbed ops module stack is itself a major surface area where Phase 4 content depth lives**. Pass 1 framed Phase 4 as primarily about workspace tabs + document templates + COA depth. Pass 2 reveals that **per-class operations UI depth is a separate (and currently more asymmetric) axis**. STR friendlies have zero class-specific operations modules today; MF friendlies have one shallow one. Marina has the gold standard with 13 module entries and 8 dedicated tabbed modules. This is a meaningful Phase 4 scope question.

**Pass 3 prioritization recommendation, informed by Pass 2 findings, leaning per task guidance toward (c) user-visible per-class polish surfaces:**

1. **STR OM template, STR DD checklist** — concrete, scoped, addresses immediate friendly demo gap. Pass 1 + Pass 2 both surfaced. (medium each, ~4-6h total)
2. **Wizard data shape S4 fix** — rename `marinaName`/`marinaAddress` → `propertyName`/`propertyAddress` end-to-end, plus dialog icon, plus `renderMarinaDetailsStep` rename, plus `portfolioMarinas` → `portfolioProperties`. (medium, ~3-5h, touches schema + state + ~10 read sites)
3. **Storage Leases tab `Anchor` icon hardcoded leak** (Pass 2 A16) — quick win for visible non-marina friction. (small, ~30 min)
4. **MF DD checklist** — friendly evaluating MF deal today gets generic CRE DD; deserves MF-tailored items. (medium, ~3-4h)
5. **valuator-* stack deletion** — 5,375 lines of dead code, zero regression risk per S1 verification. (small, ~1h)
6. **Operations sidebar STR module decision** — product question: does STR need a dedicated tabbed ops module? If yes, scope it. (large if scoped to build; small if scoped to defer.)
7. **Wizard Property Details data flow** — even after rename, the underlying schema may need migration. (depends on #2)
8. **Parallel profit-center registry drift** (Pass 2 #85) — reconcile or document the dual-source intent. (small, ~1h)
9. **Audit Trail 500 / Assumption Audit HTML** — pre-existing §3.5 bugs that fire in both Journey A and Journey B. (small each)
10. **Replacement Cost for STR + MF** — large, deferred per §3.5; not in top 10 if leaning (c) since users don't need it for demo flow.

Decision points the user should weigh:
- **Operations sidebar parity**: Does STR need a dedicated MultifamilyTabbed-style module? Or is STR's operating model thin enough (one listing, one channel mix, one PMS) that no dedicated module is needed?
- **Phase 4 depth-vs-breadth**: Do we deepen MF/marina COA_FIELD sets (Pass 1 S3, S7) to STR-depth, or accept the structural difference?
- **Per-class DD checklists**: Just MF for MVP? Or both MF + STR?

**Confirmed scope: NO code changes today, only documentation.**

## 5. Prioritized work list (Pass 3)

Surfaces are ranked into two columns: **Core (Phase 4a candidates)** and **Ops (Phase 4b candidates)**, per §3.7 product structure split. Each row has friendly-value (0-5), effort (S <2h · M 2-8h · L >8h), and dependencies.

Friendly-value scale (0-5): **5** = friendly will notice missing immediately during a demo · **4** = friendly will notice within first session · **3** = friendly will notice on second session or close inspection · **2** = friendly may notice eventually · **1** = friendly likely never notices · **0** = internal-only cleanup.

### 5.A — Core (Phase 4a) — 18 items

The top 4 are the **Phase 4a anchors** per Brett's Q4 direction. Remaining 14 are ranked but flexible within Phase 4a scope.

| Rank | Surface | Friendly-value | Effort | Dependencies | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** [ANCHOR] | **STR OM template** — build `server/templates/om-templates/str-om.ts` modeled after `multifamily-om.ts` + STR-appropriate sections (Listing Setup, Channel Mix, Pricing Strategy, Cleaning & Turnover, RevPAR/ADR metrics, comparable STRs). Register in `om-templates/index.ts`. | 5 | M (~6h) | None | Pass 1 #52. Highest-visibility STR demo gap. |
| **2** [ANCHOR] | **S4 wizard data shape fix** — rename `marinaName`→`propertyName`, `marinaAddress`→`propertyAddress`, `portfolioMarinas`→`portfolioProperties` in `OnboardingWizard.tsx` (line 285-286, ~10 read sites). Rename `renderMarinaDetailsStep`→`renderPropertyDetailsStep`. Dialog header icon read from `config.unitMix.tabIcon`. Plus DealType `owned_marina`→`owned_property`. | 4 | M (~6h) | Schema migration check (no DB writes today, but check downstream readers of project state). | Pass 1 S4 / Pass 2 rows 86-88. |
| **3** [ANCHOR] | **User-editable COA mapping** — settings UI for org-level COA overrides. Add `coa_overrides` table, settings page (CRUD per class), wire `inferDepartment` to read overrides before fallback cascade, per-org caching, role permissions, audit log. Per-class COA coverage (Decision 2: relevance-driven) is bundled — friendlies tune defaults via this editor. | 5 | L (~24-30h = 3-4 days) | Depends on resolving registry edit scope (`inferDepartment` cascade only, or PRO_FORMA_REGISTRY too?). | Promoted from §3.6 to Phase 4a on 2026-05-19. Single biggest Core depth lever. |
| **4** [ANCHOR] | **Ops gating mechanism placeholder + Phase 0 design audit for 4b** — design + ship per-project `ownershipState` flag (`owned` / `evaluated` / `null`) in `modeling_projects` schema. Wire sidebar `opsModuleKey` filter to also check `ownershipState === 'owned'` for current project. Document the activation matrix (tier × user_type × ownershipState) and capture decisions in a §3.7 follow-up. This unblocks 4b. | 5 | M (~6-8h spec + minimal stub) | Schema migration for `ownershipState` column. | Per §3.7. Unblocks all Phase 4b work. The Phase 0 audit deliverable is a separate document. |
| 5 | **STR DD checklist** — build `server/templates/ddTemplates/str.ts` with STR-specific items (host fee verification, channel mix audit, occupancy by season, cleaning fee structure, dynamic pricing tool, license/permits, HOA/STR-ordinance status, smart lock + insurance). Wire into `ddTemplates/index.ts`. | 4 | M (~4h) | None | Pass 1 #53 + Decision 3 (both DD checklists for MVP). |
| 6 | **MF DD checklist** — build `server/templates/ddTemplates/multifamily.ts` with MF-specific items (rent roll vs lease file reconciliation, T-12 OpEx variance, submarket vacancy/new supply, lease audit, utility sub-meter verification, R&M turnover history, concession/loss-to-lease analysis). | 4 | M (~4h) | None | Pass 1 #53 + Decision 3. |
| 7 | **Pro Forma Charts y=0 bug** — diagnose + fix per memory `project_pro_forma_chart_flat_zero_bug`. Chart plots y=0 across 2026-2030 while KPI tiles above show real NOI. Likely chart data source mismatched from engine. | 5 (if it fires) | S-M (~3h) | None | Pre-existing §3.5. Friendly-blocker if it fires during demo. |
| 8 | **Pre-existing §3.5 bugs that fire in both journeys** — Audit Trail tab 500, Assumption Audit HTML-not-JSON. Each ~2h. | 4 | S each (~4h total) | None | §3.5 / Pass 2 A39. |
| 9 | **Reimbursement routing for MF** — quick fix add `'reimburs'` substring to Other Income branch in `inferDepartment` per §3.5. Risk: false positive on expense items containing "reimburs" (unlikely). | 3 | S (~2h) | None | Pairs with anchor 3 (user-editable COA) — overrides will be the proper fix; this is the stop-gap. |
| 10 | **`pct()` helper boundary fix** — decision pass on the 3 candidates in §3.5, then implement chosen contract + audit all callers + migrate data. | 3 | S-M (~3-4h, mostly decision + caller audit) | None | §3.5 / surfaced from MF fixture seed. |
| 11 | **Storage Leases anchor-icon hardcoded leak** — `workspace.tsx:174` hardcodes `Anchor` icon for the storage-leases tab entry. Replace with class-aware icon from `config.unitMix.tabIcon`. | 3 | S (~1h) | None | Pass 2 A16. Trivial visible fix. |
| 12 | **valuator-\* stack deletion** — 9 files, 5,375 lines, fully orphan per S1. Remove import in `workspace.tsx:104`, delete 9 files, run TypeScript check. | 3 (cleanup) | S (~1h) | None | Pass 2 S1 confirmed zero regression. |
| 13 | **Parallel profit-center registry reconcile** — Pass 2 #85. Two parallel registries for same conceptual data (`MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY[ac].profitCenters.departments` vs `asset-class-catalog.ts.{ASSET}_PROFIT_CENTERS`). Decide canonical, deprecate the other, or document intent. | 3 | S-M (~2h) | None | Pass 2 finding. Should pair with anchor 3 (user-editable COA) sequencing — single source first. |
| 14 | **Doc-intel marina hardcoding cleanup** — 4 code paths in `doc-intel-service.ts` (L211/L219, L2401-2441, L2528). Make asset-class-aware or move to registry. | 3 | M (~6h) | None | §3.5 / Pass 1 #71-#73. |
| 15 | **MARINA_FIELDS depth pass** — bring `MARINA_FIELDS` in `direct-input-coa.ts` from 27 lines to roughly the depth of MULTIFAMILY_FIELDS (50) or STR_FIELDS (57). Add fields for fuel margin, average ticket, slip occupancy by section, service labor utilization. | 4 | M (~4h) | None | Pass 1 S3. Closes the marina direct-input gap independently of valuator-* deletion. |
| 16 | **Token resolver marina branches cleanup** — `token-resolver-service.ts:107, 137-138, 157`. Generalize via unit count + assetClass coalesce; remove marina-as-default branches. | 2 | S (~2h) | None | Pass 1 #64-65. |
| 17 | **unitMix tabIcon audit across 32 configs** — `MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY` — verify each config has a class-appropriate icon and not the default marina/anchor leak. Fix any wrong defaults. | 2 | S (~2h) | None | §3.5 / Pass 1 #4. Mostly trivial config edits. |
| 18 | **unitMix label naming policy decision + apply** — institutional convention ("Unit Mix") vs operator convention ("Slips", "Listings"). Decide + apply per-class. | 2 | S (~1-2h after decision) | None | §3.5 open product question / Pass 1 #5. |

**Core total estimate: 80-110 hours = 2-3 weeks at 40h/week** (within Phase 4a target of 2-3 weeks).

### 5.B — Ops (Phase 4b) — 9 items

Phase 4b starts with its own Phase 0 audit (driven by anchor 4 above). Items below are scoped at the placeholder level.

| Rank | Surface | Friendly-value | Effort | Dependencies | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Phase 4b Phase 0 audit** — extends anchor 4 above. Detailed activation matrix design, schema additions, sidebar gating wiring, ops-tab insertion points in workspace, telemetry plan. Output: a 4b-scope spec doc separate from this audit. | 5 | M (~40h = 1 week) | Anchor 4 stub landed. | Decision-only week. No 4b code starts until this lands. |
| 2 | **STR Ops MVP module** — `pages/operations/str/` with 5 sub-tabs: Listings (master listing roster with status/availability), Bookings (reservation pipeline), Channel Mix (Airbnb / VRBO / direct / OTA share + revenue by channel), Cleaning Ops (turnover schedule + cleaner assignment), Pricing (dynamic pricing config + per-listing rate strategy). | 5 | L (~6 weeks for full v1.0 module — 1 week per sub-tab + 1 week glue) | Phase 4b Phase 0 audit complete · PMS connector framework (item 3). | Decision 1 (full-build) / Pass 2 finding. Sub-tabs sized to roughly mirror marina ops module depth. |
| 3 | **PMS connector framework** — adapter interface for Bookd, Guesty, Hostaway, Lodgify, OwnerRez. Connector contract: list listings, fetch reservations, fetch financials, push pricing. Bookd treated as one PMS option among several per Reading A; reference Bookd's existing `ChannelAdapter` pattern but don't depend on it. | 5 | L (~2 weeks for framework + 1 connector reference impl) | Phase 4b Phase 0 audit. | Decision 1 framing. Reference impl probably Hostaway or OwnerRez (well-documented APIs). |
| 4 | **Operations sidebar gating per project ownership** — wire `opsModuleKey` filter to also check `ownershipState === 'owned'` for the current project context. Module visibility tied to current-project ownership, not just org-pack flags. | 4 | M (~6h) | Anchor 4 schema lands. | Implements §3.7 activation mechanism end-to-end for sidebar. |
| 5 | **MF Ops depth pass** — current `MultifamilyTabbed` has 4 sub-tabs (Dashboard, Units, Lease Expiry, Turn Tracking). Add Rent Roll Detail (single-source-of-truth with workspace), Renewals Workflow, Concessions Tracking, R&M Work Order Log. Don't try to match marina's depth — match MF operator's real workflow. | 3 | L (~1 week) | Phase 4b Phase 0 audit. | Pass 2 finding (MF Ops shallow). |
| 6 | **Marina Ops formalization** — exists today, but probably isn't gated by ownership state. Add the gating, ensure it lives in §3.7 product structure. No new modules. | 3 | M (~1 week) | Anchor 4 schema lands. | Pass 2 finding (currently un-gated). |
| 7 | **Retail Ops** — v1.1 placeholder. Tenant Roster, Lease Expiry, CAM Reconciliation, Percentage Rent Tracker. | 2 | (v1.1) | — | Captured for visibility; not in 4b scope. |
| 8 | **Self-Storage Ops** — v1.1 placeholder. Unit Inventory, Tenant Roster, Move-In/Move-Out, Auction Tracking. | 2 | (v1.1) | — | Captured for visibility; not in 4b scope. |
| 9 | **Hotel Ops** — v1.1 placeholder. Room Inventory, Reservations, RevPAR by Channel, Housekeeping Schedule, F&B Daily Sales. | 2 | (v1.1) | — | Captured for visibility; not in 4b scope. |

**Phase 4b in-scope (items 1-6) total estimate: 9-10 weeks** (within Phase 4b target of 6-10 weeks, slightly toward upper bound). Items 7-9 are v1.1 placeholders, not in this scope.

**Stop condition check (Pass 3):**
- Prioritized work list size: 18 + 9 = **27 items**. Under 30 stop condition.
- Phase 4a scope: 2-3 weeks. Within target.
- Phase 4b STR Ops MVP features: 5 (Listings, Bookings, Channel Mix, Cleaning Ops, Pricing). Under 15 stop condition.
- §8 draft: will keep under 100 lines (Section 7 below).

## 6. Phase 4a + 4b scope drafts

### 6.A — Phase 4a (Core completeness) scope

#### Anchor 1 — STR OM template
- **Effort:** ~6h
- **Files touched:**
  - NEW `server/templates/om-templates/str-om.ts` (~150 lines, modeled after `multifamily-om.ts`)
  - `server/templates/om-templates/index.ts` (register `strOMTemplate` in `omTemplateRegistry`)
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - `getOMTemplatesByAssetClass('str')` returns `strOMTemplate`.
  - OM builder UI for an STR project surfaces the STR template as default.
  - Generated OM PDF includes STR-appropriate sections (Listing Setup, Channel Mix table, Pricing Strategy, Cleaning & Turnover, RevPAR/ADR metrics, Comparable STRs).
  - All sections have non-empty `defaultContent`.
- **Dependencies:** None.
- **Verification:** Generate an OM for the STR fixture `b1a0eebc-...` and confirm all sections render. Compare narrative depth against `marinaOMTemplate` + `multifamilyOMTemplate`.

#### Anchor 2 — S4 wizard data shape fix
- **Status:** SPLIT after Phase 0 (2026-05-20). Safe subset shipped in commit `9eb02294`; `marinaName` + `owned_marina` moved to Anchor 2b below.
- **Effort:** ~6h estimated → ~2h actual for the shipped safe subset.
- **Files touched:**
  - `client/src/components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx` — rename state fields ~~`marinaName`→`propertyName`~~ *(deferred → Anchor 2b)*, `marinaAddress`→`propertyAddress`, `portfolioMarinas`→`portfolioProperties`, `validMarinas`→`validProperties`. Rename `renderMarinaDetailsStep`→`renderPropertyDetailsStep`. Dialog header icon read from `getModelConfig(state.assetClass).unitMix.tabIcon` via the existing `iconMap` (promoted to module scope). ~~DealType `owned_marina`→`owned_property`~~ *(deferred → Anchor 2b)*.
  - Schema: confirmed — the 4 shipped renames are pure form-local wizard state; no DB column relies on them.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - `grep -rn "marinaAddress\|portfolioMarinas\|validMarinas\|renderMarinaDetailsStep" client/src/components/onboarding/` returns 0 hits. ✅
  - Wizard renders for marina, STR, MF — dialog header icon is class-appropriate. ✅
  - ~~`marinaName` → 0 hits~~ / ~~`owned_marina` → 0 hits~~ — **deferred to Anchor 2b** (cross the wizard→server→DB boundary).
- **Dependencies:** None.
- **Verification:** `tsc -b shared` clean; scoped tsc 0 new errors vs HEAD `2469bfb0`; dev server health 200.
- **Phase 0 finding (2026-05-20):** The audit estimated ~10 read sites / 6h. Phase 0 measured ~62 grep hits (all in `OnboardingWizard.tsx`) and found 2 of the 6 renames cross the wizard→server→DB boundary: `marinaName` is the `POST /api/modeling/projects` payload key (`server/routes/crm-routes.ts:13937`, written to the `modeling_projects.marina_name` column); `owned_marina` is a live Postgres `deal_source` enum value (`shared/schema.ts:143`) with ~13 server/client consumers, also written into `customMetrics.dealType` JSONB. Both trip the brief's STOP conditions, so they split into Anchor 2b. The 4 wizard-local renames + class-aware dialog icon shipped as the safe subset.

#### Anchor 2b — marinaName / owned_marina migration (deferred from Anchor 2)
- **Effort:** ~8-12h (re-sized from Anchor 2's original 6h)
- **Files touched (expected ~15):**
  - `client/src/components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx` — rename `marinaName` state field + submit payload key
  - `server/routes/crm-routes.ts` — accept new payload key (with transitional support for the old key during the migration window) and write to the renamed column
  - DB migration (raw SQL): rename `modeling_projects.marina_name` to `modeling_projects.property_name` OR add a `property_name` column + dual-write during cutover
  - DB migration (raw SQL): add `owned_property` to the `dealSourceEnum` Postgres enum; backfill `customMetrics.dealType = 'owned_marina'` to `'owned_property'` for existing projects
  - `shared/schema.ts` — update the `dealSourceEnum` declaration + column name in the Drizzle type
  - ~13 callsite updates across `server/routes/returns-routes.ts`, `server/routes/modeling-routes.ts`, `server/routes/crm-routes.ts`, `server/services/integration-data-pipeline.ts` and client-side consumers (DealType filter UIs, project list displays)
  - Test fixtures that hardcode `'owned_marina'`
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - `grep -rn "marinaName\|owned_marina" client/ server/ shared/` returns 0 hits OUTSIDE of migration files and code comments referencing the rename history
  - All existing projects with `customMetrics.dealType = 'owned_marina'` successfully backfilled
  - `tsc` clean, dev server health 200, no regressions
- **Dependencies:** Anchor 2 safe subset shipped (commit `9eb02294`).
- **Verification:** Pre-migration snapshot of projects with `marina_name` and `customMetrics.dealType = 'owned_marina'`; post-migration confirm same row count with new field/value; spot-check 3 projects load cleanly in workspace.

#### Anchor 3 — User-editable COA mapping (RE-SCOPED 2026-05-21)
- **Status:** RE-SCOPED after Phase 0 reconnaissance (2026-05-21). The original entry — ~24-30h: a `coa_overrides` bolt-on table + an `inferDepartment`-cascade hook in `direct-input-engine.ts` + a new `coa-editor.tsx` settings page — is **superseded**. It is the rejected **Path 1** (see Decision below). Original entry text preserved in git history (this commit's parent and earlier). The work is re-scoped into **Anchor 3-pre** (consolidation prerequisite) + **Anchor 3** (override layer + UI), both below.

**Finding — World B (2026-05-21 reconnaissance).** The spec's "user-editable COA mapping" presupposes a *canonical COA entity that does not exist*. "COA" currently resolves to **~7 distinct stores**:
- *Per-asset-class code registries:* `COA_FIELD_REGISTRY` (`shared/direct-input-coa.ts:898`), `COA_REGISTRY` (`server/services/direct-input-engine.ts:608`), `PRO_FORMA_REGISTRY` (`shared/pro-forma-config.ts:934`), `MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY` (`shared/asset-class-model-config.ts:4349`).
- *DB-backed org-scoped subsystems:* `chart_of_accounts` / `coa_mapping` / `coa_mapping_suggestions` / `coa_audit_log`; `coa_user_aliases` / `coa_mapped_line_items`; the `fin_coa_*` family.
- *Seed layer:* `server/services/coa-taxonomy-seed.ts`, `server/services/pnl/canonical-seed.ts`.

The editable entity `key → category / department / treatment` is **not assembled anywhere**: `category` is duplicated across two registries (`COA_FIELD_REGISTRY` + `COA_REGISTRY`); `department` lives in a separate, scattered inference subsystem (`server/utils/department-mapping.ts:30` + ~14 consumers + a duplicated client copy at `client/src/lib/department-inference.ts`); `treatment` does not exist in the COA layer at all. The engine COA read *is* a clean single chokepoint (`direct-input-engine.ts:655`, inside `computeDirectInputFinancials()`, ~12 downstream call sites) — but there is **no single resolver that assembles the full mapping**, so overrides cannot be injected at one point. The original ~24-30h estimate assumed exactly that clean resolver to layer overrides into; it does not hold.

**Decision — Path 2 (unify, not bolt-on).** Unify the direct-input registries onto the existing DB-backed COA persistence rather than bolting a new override layer onto static code. Rationale: the existing `coa_mapping` / `coa_user_aliases` / `fin_coa_*` machinery and the `CoaMappingReview.tsx` UI already provide org-scoped CRUD, per-org overrides, alias-learning, and audit logging — they are simply wired to the upload / doc-intel COA, not the direct-input registries. **Path 1** — a new bolt-on override layer (the original `coa_overrides` table) — is **rejected**: it would add an 8th COA store to a system whose core problem is fragmentation. **Path 2** consolidates *and* doubles as the §3.5 / §7.B "parallel COA registries" debt paydown — the registry-debt paydown and the feature prerequisite are the same work.

The real work is consolidate-then-override, split as follows:

#### Anchor 3-pre — Canonical COA consolidation (prerequisite, split from Anchor 3)
- Define the canonical editable COA entity (`key → category / department / treatment`).
- Consolidate `category` (de-dup across `COA_FIELD_REGISTRY` + `COA_REGISTRY`), `department` (extract from `department-mapping.ts` + ~14 consumers + the duplicated client copy into the canonical entity), and introduce `treatment`.
- Produce a single resolver that assembles the full mapping, fronting the existing `direct-input-engine.ts:655` chokepoint.
- **HIGH RISK:** touches the engine read path that ~12 production call sites funnel through. Regression surface is the core financial engine. Must be done on a stable environment with a careful Phase 0 and incremental verification — rushing this destabilizes the engine to deliver a settings feature.
- Pays down the §3.5 / §7.B "parallel COA registries" debt as a side effect.
- Delivers standalone value even if Anchor 3 (UI) slips — consolidation improves everything downstream.
- **Effort:** TBD by its own Phase 0 — multi-session. Do NOT estimate firmly until a dedicated Phase 0 maps the ~14 department-inference consumers and the `category` de-dup blast radius.
- **Dependencies:** None — but run it on a stable environment, not under deadline pressure.

#### Anchor 3 — Org-editable COA override layer + UI (depends on 3-pre)
- Once 3-pre yields a canonical COA, extend the existing org-scoped persistence pattern (`coa_user_aliases`-style override + audit) to back the direct-input COA, and build/extend an editor UI (`CoaMappingReview.tsx` is a strong reference; the per-asset-class registry editor itself is greenfield).
- Relatively cheaper than 3-pre — the hard consolidation is done and the persistence + UI patterns already exist.
- **Open product question for Brett:** per-field remapping vs. whole-COA-per-class editing (drives UI scope).
- **Dependency:** Anchor 3-pre complete.
- **Effort:** TBD — sized after 3-pre's Phase 0; smaller than 3-pre.

#### Anchor 4 — Ops gating mechanism placeholder + Phase 0 design audit for 4b
- **Effort:** ~6-8h for stub + activation matrix doc (the full Phase 4b Phase 0 audit is ~1 week and lives in 4b scope, item 1 of §5.B)
- **Files touched:**
  - DB migration (raw SQL): add `ownership_state` column to `modeling_projects` — enum `('evaluated', 'owned', 'archived')` default `'evaluated'`.
  - `shared/schema.ts` — add to type. (Drizzle is read-only for the column to avoid the RLS-empty pitfall per CLAUDE.md.)
  - NEW `BETA_MVP_PHASE_4B_PHASE_0.md` at workspace root — captures activation matrix decisions (tier × user_type × ownership_state), schema decisions, sidebar gating contract, telemetry plan. This is the spec deliverable, not code.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - `ownership_state` column exists in `modeling_projects` with default 'evaluated'.
  - All existing projects backfill to 'evaluated' on migration.
  - Activation matrix document committed to workspace root.
  - Sidebar `opsModuleKey` filter logic in `unified-sidebar.tsx` documented but not yet wired (wiring is 4b item 4).
- **Dependencies:** None.
- **Verification:** Migration runs cleanly, every existing project has `ownership_state = 'evaluated'`. Document review by Brett.

#### Items 5-18 — Phase 4a remainder
Effort estimates rolled up:

| Item | Effort | Files |
|---|---|---|
| 5. STR DD checklist | ~4h | NEW `server/templates/ddTemplates/str.ts` + `ddTemplates/index.ts` |
| 6. MF DD checklist | ~4h | NEW `server/templates/ddTemplates/multifamily.ts` + `ddTemplates/index.ts` |
| 7. Pro Forma Charts y=0 bug — **RESOLVED 2026-05-20 (commit `931fbbe3`)** | ~3h (est.) | Real fix was in `pro-forma.tsx` — the NOI Projection chart on the *Pro Forma* tab — NOT the audit-named `pro-forma-charts.tsx`. See note below. |
| 7b. Rewrite mock `pro-forma-charts` endpoint to call the engine — **PRE-BETA BLOCKER** | ~4-6h | `server/routes/analytics-routes.ts:1248` — replace hardcoded marina literals with a `proFormaEngineService` call. See note below. |
| 8. Audit Trail 500 + Assumption Audit HTML | ~4h | `workspace/audit-trail.tsx`, `workspace/assumption-audit.tsx` + server routes |

**Note on Items 7 / 7b (Pro Forma chart) — Phase 4a Item 7 Phase 0, 2026-05-20.**
The audit named the wrong file. The original §3.5 bug (memory `project_pro_forma_chart_flat_zero_bug`) — the "NOI Projection — N-Year Hold" chart plotting a flat y=0 line while the KPI tiles directly above it showed real NOI — was a **client-side field-name mismatch in `client/src/pages/modeling/projects/workspace/pro-forma.tsx`**, not in `pro-forma-charts.tsx`. The chart re-summed line items reading `item.yearlyValues` / `item.projectedValues`, neither of which exists on the engine's `LineItem`; both resolved `undefined → ?? 0`, giving the flat zero line. **Fixed in commit `931fbbe3`** — the chart now reads `proFormaData.annualProjections`. That closes Item 7.

Tracing the audit's mis-pointer to `pro-forma-charts.tsx` surfaced a separate, worse problem, filed here as **Item 7b**. The "Pro Forma Charts" workspace tab is fed by `GET /api/analytics/modeling/projects/:projectId/pro-forma-charts` (`server/routes/analytics-routes.ts:1248`), which is a **100% mock**: it returns hardcoded marina-flavored literals (Wet Slips $2.45M, Fuel Sales $2.85M, NOI $4.37M, 6.8% cap rate), destructures but never uses `projectId` / `year`, and is byte-identical for every project and asset class.
- **Friendly-value: 5.** **Flag: blocker — pre-beta.** This is worse than the flat-zero chart Item 7 fixed: a flat-zero line reads as "no data," whereas a mock renders plausible, professional-looking fabricated financials a friendly will mistake for their own deal. Shipping fabricated numbers to friendlies is a credibility hazard.
- **Effort ~4-6h:** rewrite the endpoint to call `proFormaEngineService` (the engine behind `GET /api/modeling/projects/:projectId/pro-forma`) and derive chart aggregations from real per-project data.
- **Fallback:** gate or hide the "Pro Forma Charts" tab if 7b is not built before friendlies — a disabled tab is honest; a mock-fed tab is a credibility hazard.
- Also captured in `BETA_MVP_SPEC.md` §3.5 + its Appendix B. Net Phase 4a effort impact is small (Item 7 closing ≈ offsets Item 7b's add); the rollup table below is left as-is within its stated ±buffer.

#### Phase 4a rollup

| Bucket | Hours |
|---|---|
| 4 anchors (items 1-4) | ~40-50h |
| Items 5-18 (remainder) | ~40-46h |
| **Total** | **~80-96 hours** |
| **Weeks (40h/week)** | **2.0-2.4 weeks** |

Within Phase 4a target (2-3 weeks). Adds ~10-20% buffer for verification, articulation blocks, and any unanticipated dependencies — still under 3 weeks total.

### 6.B — Phase 4b (Ops productization) scope

Less detailed because 4b starts with its own Phase 0 audit. Captured here at the planning level.

#### Phase 4b Phase 0 audit (~1 week — item 1 of §5.B)

The audit deliverable is `BETA_MVP_PHASE_4B_PHASE_0.md` (stub created during anchor 4 in 4a). Must answer:

1. **Activation matrix decisions** — what combinations of (tier × user_type × ownership_state) activate which Ops modules? Default rule: `ownership_state === 'owned'` activates the class-specific Ops tab for that project's asset class. Layered rules pending design (e.g., does an `analyst` user under an `institutional` tier always see Ops in read-only mode regardless of ownership?).
2. **Schema additions** — beyond `modeling_projects.ownership_state`, do we need `ops_module_enabled` per (org_id, project_id, module_key)? Or is the rule purely derived?
3. **Sidebar gating contract** — `opsModuleKey` filter today gates by org packs. New filter: gate by (org pack) AND (current project ownership) when in project context. Document the precedence.
4. **Ops tab insertion in workspace** — does the Ops module live as a sidebar entry (today's pattern) or also as a workspace tab inside the project view? If both: which is canonical?
5. **Telemetry plan** — how do we measure Ops module usage for v1.0 → v1.1 prioritization?
6. **Cross-class data plumbing** — does the Pro Forma engine consume Ops actuals (today: not really, except for marina's `enrichFromProfitCenters` per Pass 1 #62)? If yes, the bridge is its own scope item.
7. **Sub-audit decisions** — registry edit scope for anchor 3 (PRO_FORMA_REGISTRY editability) if not resolved during Phase 4a.

#### STR Ops MVP feature inventory (5 features, ~6 weeks build — item 2 of §5.B)

Each sub-tab sized at ~1 week build + 1 week glue.

| Sub-tab | Scope summary | Key data |
|---|---|---|
| Listings | Master listing roster: address, listing IDs across platforms, bedrooms/baths/guests, amenities, status (active / paused / archived), photos count, listing-level revenue summary. | One row per listing. Synced from PMS. |
| Bookings | Reservation pipeline: upcoming + past stays, guest name (PII gated), nights, channel, nightly rate, cleaning fee, total, status (confirmed / cancelled / completed). Day/week/month aggregation views. | Per-reservation rows. PMS-synced. |
| Channel Mix | Revenue + bookings share by channel (Airbnb / VRBO / Booking.com / direct / other OTA). Time-series view, period-over-period comparison. ADR by channel. Take-rate / commission audit. | Aggregated from Bookings. |
| Cleaning Ops | Turnover schedule (calendar view) by listing. Cleaner assignment + status (assigned / in-progress / inspected / ready). Avg turnover time. Cleaning fee billed vs. cost. | Per-turn rows. May integrate with cleaner-side tools (Turno, Properly) post-MVP. |
| Pricing | Dynamic pricing config (base rate, weekend premium, seasonal multipliers, gap-night discounts), per-listing rate strategy override, peek at next 90 days of expected rates. Integration hooks for PriceLabs / Wheelhouse / Beyond Pricing in v1.1. | Per-listing pricing config. |

Excludes from v1.0 STR Ops (deferred to v1.1): cleaner payroll/payments, owner statements (handled by separate LP-reporting flow), maintenance work-order tracking, multi-property portfolio analytics beyond Channel Mix.

#### PMS connector framework (~2 weeks — item 3 of §5.B)

Reference Bookd's existing `ChannelAdapter` pattern for shape, but build fresh in Vantage to avoid coupling. Connector contract:

```typescript
interface PMSConnector {
  id: 'bookd' | 'guesty' | 'hostaway' | 'lodgify' | 'ownerrez';
  authenticate(orgId: string, credentials: PMSCredentials): Promise<PMSAuthResult>;
  listListings(connectionId: string): Promise<PMSListing[]>;
  fetchReservations(connectionId: string, range: DateRange): Promise<PMSReservation[]>;
  fetchFinancials(connectionId: string, range: DateRange): Promise<PMSFinancialLine[]>;
  pushPricing?(connectionId: string, listingId: string, rates: PricingRates): Promise<void>;
}
```

V1.0 ships:
- Framework + types.
- 1 reference connector implementation (recommend Hostaway or OwnerRez — well-documented APIs).
- Stubs for the other 4 connectors (Bookd, Guesty, Lodgify, plus the unbuilt one of Hostaway/OwnerRez).

V1.1 adds: real implementations for the other connectors as friendlies demand them.

#### MF Ops depth pass (~1 week — item 5 of §5.B)

Current `MultifamilyTabbed` has 4 sub-tabs: Dashboard, Units, Lease Expiry, Turn Tracking. Add for v1.0:
- **Rent Roll Detail** — single source of truth shared with workspace's storage-leases tab; resolves dual-source risk.
- **Renewals Workflow** — leases up for renewal in next 60/90/180 days; renewal offer status (sent / accepted / declined / pending).
- **Concessions Tracking** — concession by unit / lease term, $ + % impact on EGI.
- **R&M Work Order Log** — open / closed work orders, $/unit cost trend.

Out of scope for v1.0 (v1.1): tenant portal, payment processing, eviction tracking, AR aging.

#### Marina Ops formalization (~1 week — item 6 of §5.B)

Marina Ops modules exist today (Pass 2 row 81) and are unconditionally available in the sidebar gated by `opsModuleKey`. After anchor 4 lands, wire each marina ops module's `opsModuleKey` to also respect `ownership_state === 'owned'`. No new modules; just enforcement of the activation matrix on the existing 8 modules.

#### Phase 4b rollup

| Item | Weeks |
|---|---|
| 1. Phase 0 audit | 1 |
| 2. STR Ops MVP build (5 sub-tabs) | 6 |
| 3. PMS connector framework + 1 reference impl | 2 |
| 4. Sidebar gating wiring | 0.2 |
| 5. MF Ops depth pass | 1 |
| 6. Marina Ops formalization | 0.5-1 |
| **Total** | **~10-11 weeks** |

Slightly above the 6-10 week target's upper bound. Two levers to tighten if needed:
- Defer Marina Ops formalization to early v1.1 (its functionality exists today; gating is the only delta).
- STR Ops MVP from 6 weeks to 4 weeks by deferring Cleaning Ops + Pricing to v1.1 (keeps Listings + Bookings + Channel Mix as the MVP triad, which most institutional STR friendlies will demo around).

Item 7-9 (Retail / Self-Storage / Hotel Ops) are v1.1 placeholders — captured in §5.B for visibility, **not in 4b scope**.

## 7. Draft §8 update for BETA_MVP_SPEC.md

This is the text I'll apply to BETA_MVP_SPEC.md §8 in the same Pass 3 commit. Kept under 100 lines per stop condition.

```markdown
## 8. Per-class content inventory (Phase 1.5 — completed 2026-05-19)

Phase 1.5 audit completed across three passes:
- **Pass 1** — grep-driven enumeration + 4-registry audit + tab-gate audit (commit `cef8f749`).
- **Pass 2** — code-walkthrough user-journey friction log for Journey A (MF investor) and Journey B (marina owner) (commit `3ad61100`).
- **Pass 3** — prioritized work list + Phase 4a / 4b scope drafts (this commit).

Structured backing data lives in `BETA_MVP_PHASE_1_5_AUDIT.md` at workspace root. That document contains the full inventory (~89 surfaces across 11 categories), the journey friction log (~60 entries across both journeys), the prioritized work list (18 Core + 9 Ops items), and detailed scope drafts.

### Headline findings

**Registry coverage:** All 4 registries (`MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY`, `COA_REGISTRY`, `COA_FIELD_REGISTRY`, `PRO_FORMA_REGISTRY`) cover all 3 MVP classes (marina, STR, MF) at 100% breadth. Depth varies — STR_COA is 7× deeper than MARINA_COA / MULTIFAMILY_COA; MARINA_FIELDS is the shortest direct-input field set.

**STR has the biggest Core gap:** missing OM template, missing DD template, missing rent-roll-v2 adapter. These are the highest-priority Phase 4a items (3 concrete deliverables).

**S4 — Wizard data shape leak:** `marinaName` / `marinaAddress` / `portfolioMarinas` written for all classes regardless of asset class. Phase 4a anchor.

**S1 — orphan valuator-\* stack:** 5,375 lines of marina-specific UI code imported but not rendered. Verified 0% overlap with active code paths. Safe to delete in Phase 4a (item 12).

**Operations sidebar asymmetry (new in Pass 2):** marina has 13 sidebar entries / 8 dedicated tabbed-ops modules; MF has 1 module / 4 sub-tabs; STR has 0. This is a Phase 4b (Ops productization) scope dimension, not Phase 4a.

### Phase 4 split — Core vs Ops (per §3.7)

**Phase 4a — Core completeness (per-class modeling polish).** 18 items, 4 anchors. Estimate 2.0-2.4 weeks (80-96h). See §6.A of `BETA_MVP_PHASE_1_5_AUDIT.md`.

Phase 4a anchors:
1. STR OM template
2. S4 wizard data shape fix (`marinaName` → `propertyName`)
3. User-editable COA mapping (promoted from §3.6)
4. Ops gating mechanism placeholder + Phase 4b Phase 0 design audit

**Phase 4b — Ops add-on productization.** 9 items (6 in-scope for v1.0, 3 deferred to v1.1). Estimate ~10-11 weeks. See §6.B of `BETA_MVP_PHASE_1_5_AUDIT.md`.

Phase 4b sequence:
1. Phase 0 audit (1 week)
2. STR Ops MVP — 5 sub-tabs: Listings, Bookings, Channel Mix, Cleaning Ops, Pricing (6 weeks)
3. PMS connector framework + 1 reference connector (2 weeks)
4. Sidebar gating wiring (0.2 weeks)
5. MF Ops depth pass (1 week)
6. Marina Ops formalization (0.5-1 week)

### §3.5 cleanup items closed in Phase 4a

The following §3.5 entries are closed by Phase 4a:
- §3.5 "Mobile responsive audit" — out of scope (deferred to v1.1)
- §3.5 "8 duplicate Sunset Bay Marina fixtures" — bundled with valuator-* cleanup (item 12)
- §3.5 "Institutional analysis suite fixes" — separate scope, not Phase 4a
- §3.5 "Reimbursement routing for Multifamily" — item 9
- §3.5 "`STORAGE_SUB_TYPES` reconciliation" — covered by item 18 (unitMix label policy) + item 17 (icon audit)
- §3.5 "`unitMix.tabIcon` anchor-icon leak" — item 11 + item 17
- §3.5 "Inconsistent `unitMix` tab labels" — item 18
- §3.5 "`doc-intel-service.ts` marina hardcoding" — item 14
- §3.5 "LLM provider divergence" — out of scope (deferred per spec entry)
- §3.5 "`pct()` helper ambiguity" — item 10
- §3.5 "Wizard `marinaName` / `marinaAddress` leak" — anchor 2 (S4 fix)

§3.5 cleanups not closed by Phase 4a (carried forward):
- Audit Trail 500 + Assumption Audit HTML + Pro Forma Charts y=0 — items 7-8 (bundled into Phase 4a as bug-fix items, ranked 7-8)

### Total per-class content build roadmap

| Phase | Scope | Estimate | Sequencing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 4a | Core completeness across MVP classes | 2.0-2.4 weeks | Starts after Phase 1.5 commit |
| Phase 4b Phase 0 | Activation matrix design audit | 1 week | After Phase 4a anchor 4 stub lands |
| Phase 4b items 2-6 | Ops module productization | 9-10 weeks | After Phase 4b Phase 0 |
| **Total to v1.0** | **Phase 4a + 4b** | **~12-13 weeks** | |

Replacement Cost per-class build (Phase 1.5 worked example) is **NOT** in Phase 4a — marina has it via the existing `replacement-cost.tsx`; STR and MF won't get class-specific Replacement Cost UIs in MVP. Re-evaluate for v1.1 if friendly demand surfaces.
```

## 8. Pass 3 articulation block

**Total Phase 4a scope estimate:** 2.0-2.4 weeks (80-96 hours).
**Total Phase 4b scope estimate:** ~10-11 weeks (slightly above the 6-10 target's upper bound; two tightening levers identified in §6.B).

**Top 4 anchors — confirmed scope estimates:**

| Anchor | Hours | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1. STR OM template | ~6h | Modeled after `multifamily-om.ts`; no dependencies. |
| 2. S4 wizard data shape fix | ~6h | Rename + ~10 read sites + dialog icon + DealType. |
| 3. User-editable COA mapping | ~24-30h | Largest 4a item by far; depends on resolving registry edit scope. |
| 4. Ops gating placeholder + 4b Phase 0 design | ~6-8h for 4a stub | Full Phase 4b Phase 0 audit is a separate 1-week 4b item. |

**Surfaced in Pass 3 (not in Pass 1 or Pass 2):**
- The two-axis split — Core completeness (4a) vs Ops productization (4b) — formalized in §3.7 (Piece A commit) is itself a Pass 3 product structure decision worth noting in audit history.
- The relationship between anchor 3 (user-editable COA) and Pass 2 #85 (parallel profit-center registry reconcile): item 13's "reconcile or document" framing collapses into anchor 3's user-edit canonical path — overrides become the canonical user-edit path; the dual-source becomes "config defaults vs overrides" not "two competing registries."

**Items where ranking required judgment Brett should review:**

1. **Item 15 — MARINA_FIELDS depth pass at value 4, M effort.** This addresses Pass 1 S3 (marina has shortest direct-input fields). I ranked it 4 because friendlies entering marinas via direct input today see a sparse form, but no friendly has complained yet. Could deprioritize to value 3 if direct-input is a thin demo path for marinas (most marina friendlies upload P&L, not direct-input).
2. **Item 14 — Doc-intel marina hardcoding cleanup at value 3, M effort.** Could be deferred to v1.1 if the four code paths don't fire under current MF/STR uploads. Worth running a single MF + STR P&L through doc-intel and observing whether the marina paths trigger before committing 6h to this.
3. **Item 11 vs 17 — Storage Leases icon fix (single-tab fix) vs unitMix tabIcon audit (32-config sweep).** I ranked them separately because the single-tab fix is the user-visible win (~1h) and the 32-config sweep is the cleanup that prevents the same leak elsewhere (~2h). Could be bundled into one item if Brett prefers a single commit.
4. **Phase 4b STR Ops MVP — 5 sub-tabs vs 3.** Decision 1 was full-build; I sized for 5 sub-tabs (~6 weeks). Tightening lever in §6.B suggests dropping to 3 (Listings + Bookings + Channel Mix) would save 2 weeks. Reasonable for MVP demo with institutional STR friendlies; Cleaning Ops + Pricing become v1.1 priorities.
5. **Phase 4a buffer.** I sized at 80-96h (2.0-2.4 weeks) but the realistic ceiling with verification overhead is closer to 3 weeks. Worth flagging if 4a slips past 3 weeks → consider deferring items 16-18 (token resolver / icon audit / label policy) to a Phase 4a.1 cleanup wave.

**Confirmed scope: NO code changes today, only documentation.**

## Appendix B — Revision log

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-05-20 | Anchor 2 (§6.A) split into a shipped safe subset + new Anchor 2b after Phase 0 surfaced that 2 of 6 renames (`marinaName`, `owned_marina`) cross the wizard→server→DB boundary. Safe subset (4 wizard-local renames + class-aware dialog icon) shipped in commit `9eb02294`. |
| 2026-05-20 | Item 7 (§6.A) split. Item 7 (Pro Forma Charts y=0) resolved in commit `931fbbe3` — the real bug was a client-side field-name mismatch in `pro-forma.tsx`, not the audit-named `pro-forma-charts.tsx`. New **Item 7b** added: rewrite the mock `pro-forma-charts` analytics endpoint to call `proFormaEngineService` — flagged **pre-beta blocker**, ~4-6h, friendly-value 5, with a gate/hide-the-tab fallback. Also captured in `BETA_MVP_SPEC.md` §3.5. |
| 2026-05-21 | Anchor 3 (§6.A) re-scoped after World B reconnaissance. The original ~24-30h entry — a `coa_overrides` bolt-on table + an `inferDepartment` hook + a `coa-editor.tsx` settings page — is superseded; it is the rejected **Path 1**. Reconnaissance found "user-editable COA mapping" presupposes a canonical COA entity that does not exist: "COA" resolves to ~7 distinct stores, `department` is a scattered inference subsystem (`department-mapping.ts` + ~14 consumers + a duplicated client copy), and `treatment` does not exist in the COA layer. The engine read is a clean chokepoint but no single resolver assembles the full mapping. Decision: **Path 2** — unify the direct-input registries onto the existing DB-backed COA persistence (rejecting Path 1, which would add an 8th COA store); this also pays down the §3.5 / §7.B parallel-COA-registries debt. Split into **Anchor 3-pre** (canonical COA consolidation — HIGH RISK, touches the engine read path; effort TBD by its own Phase 0) and **Anchor 3** (org-editable override layer + UI; depends on 3-pre). Same split pattern as Anchor 2 → 2a/2b. |
